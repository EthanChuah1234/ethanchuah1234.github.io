💻 My Coding Journey (journey.html)

Make this page chronological with cards or timeline layout.

🧩 Scratch (Age 7+)

Where it all started! Scratch introduced me to loops, logic, and creative design. I made games, animations, and small simulations that helped me visualize programming concepts.

🕹️ Favorite Project: “Space Explorer” — a mini space game where players collect stars and avoid asteroids.

💭 What I Learned: Problem solving, algorithmic thinking, and debugging visually.

🔧 Luau (Roblox Scripting)

My first step into real coding — building systems with logic and object-oriented design.

🏗️ Highlights: Created working GUIs, in-game economy systems, and interactive NPC behavior.

💡 Lesson: Understanding events, properties, and modular scripting.

🐍 Python

My go-to language for automation, problem-solving, and experimenting with new ideas.

⚙️ Projects: Command-line tools, math problem solvers, and mini-games.

🧠 Skills: Loops, data structures, and object-oriented programming.

💻 Current Learning: Building small web apps and scripts to automate tasks.

🌐 Web Development (HTML + CSS)

The start of my web journey — learning to design and build my own pages from scratch.

🌈 Projects: Personal homepage, landing pages, and styled CV layouts.

🔍 Next Step: Adding interactivity with JavaScript and backend connectivity.

🔒 Ethical Hacking & Cybersecurity

Exploring how systems can be protected — learning the ethics, the tools, and the thought process behind hacking responsibly.

🧰 Focus Areas: Network scanning, penetration testing basics, and security awareness.

🏴‍☠️ Goal: Participate in beginner-level Capture The Flag challenges soon.
