My name is Ethan Chuah, and Iâ€™m a self-driven programmer who loves transforming ideas into real projects.
I began coding when I was 7 years old, starting with simple games on Scratch. That spark grew into a deep curiosity for how computers work, how games are built, and how the web connects everything.

Iâ€™m always exploring new tools and languages, learning how to write cleaner code, and finding creative ways to solve challenges â€” whether itâ€™s building games, designing websites, or exploring cybersecurity.
