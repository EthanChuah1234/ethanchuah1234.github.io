🧠 Ethan Chuah — Developer Portfolio
💡 About Me

Hi, I'm Ethan Chuah, a passionate and self-driven programmer with a love for solving problems and building creative digital experiences. I started my coding journey at the age of 7 on Scratch, where I discovered how fun and powerful programming can be. Since then, I’ve been expanding my skills across multiple languages and platforms, always looking for new challenges and opportunities to grow.


💻 My Coding Journey

=====================

🧩 Scratch (Age 7+)

My introduction to programming began with Scratch, where I learned the fundamentals of logic, loops, variables, and interactive design. I built games, animations, and simulations that sparked my curiosity in how things work behind the scenes.

🔧 Luau (Roblox Scripting)

Next, I got into Luau, the scripting language behind Roblox Studio. Here, I learned real-world programming structures by building custom game mechanics, GUIs, and interactive systems within 3D environments. This was my first step into more advanced scripting, and it gave me hands-on experience with object-oriented programming.

🐍 Python

To deepen my understanding of programming, I began learning Python. I’ve used it for scripting, automation, and problem-solving. I love how versatile Python is—whether it’s building a simple calculator or writing more complex logic, Python lets me bring my ideas to life quickly and efficiently.

🌐 Web Development (HTML + CSS)

Wanting to create my own websites, I picked up HTML and CSS. I’ve built simple static web pages, landing pages, and personal projects to showcase my work. I'm currently exploring how to combine this with JavaScript to make more interactive sites.

🔒 Ethical Hacking & Cybersecurity

Curiosity led me into the world of ethical hacking, where I’ve learned the basics of cybersecurity, including network vulnerabilities, penetration testing concepts, and how to protect systems from attacks. I focus on learning ethical practices to understand how to secure software and data in today’s digital world.
