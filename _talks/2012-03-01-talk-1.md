🧠 Programming Languages
🐍 Python

What I Use It For:

Automation scripts

Problem-solving challenges

Experimenting with algorithms and data structures

What I’ve Learned:
Variables, loops, functions, OOP (Object-Oriented Programming), and file handling.

Projects:

A console-based calculator

A basic password generator

Data logging for sensor readings (IoT project)

Why I Love It:
Python’s clean syntax and versatility make it my favorite language for rapid prototyping and learning core concepts.

🔧 Luau (Roblox Scripting)

What I Use It For:

Building interactive Roblox games and systems

Designing GUIs and server/client logic

What I’ve Learned:
Events, module scripts, object hierarchies, and efficient scripting practices in game environments.

Projects:

Custom game mechanics (e.g., player stats, inventories)

GUI menus and interactive systems

Why It’s Important:
Luau was my first “real” coding language — it taught me structure, debugging, and how logic drives gameplay.

🌐 HTML & CSS

What I Use It For:

Structuring and styling web pages

Building landing pages, simple personal sites, and prototypes

What I’ve Learned:
Semantic HTML, responsive design, Flexbox, and basic layout principles.

Projects:

Personal portfolio (this one!)

Static showcase pages

Next Step:
Learn JavaScript to add interactivity and dynamic features.

Why I Enjoy It:
Seeing my code turn into something visual and creative on screen is extremely rewarding.

⚙️ Tools & Platforms
🧩 Scratch

Purpose: My introduction to coding logic and game design.

Skills Gained: Visual programming, conditionals, and design thinking.

Use Case: Building prototypes or teaching others how code logic works.

🧱 Roblox Studio

Purpose: My 3D sandbox for building games and systems.

Skills Gained: 3D design, scripting in Luau, and integrating client-server logic.

Highlights: Created my own maps, game UIs, and custom interactive features.

💻 Visual Studio Code (VS Code)

Purpose: My main coding environment for Python, HTML, and CSS.

Why I Like It:

Customizable themes

Extensions (Prettier, GitHub Copilot, Live Server)

Integrated terminal and version control

Proficiency: Intermediate — comfortable with debugging and project organization.

🧬 GitHub

Purpose: Version control and sharing my projects online.

What I Know:

Creating repositories

Committing and pushing changes

Writing clean README files

Goal: Learn Git branching, pull requests, and open-source contribution.

🕹️ Fields of Interest
🎮 Game Development

I love creating interactive experiences that engage players.

Tools: Roblox Studio, Luau, Unity (exploring soon)

Skills: Game mechanics, player systems, UI design, and scripting logic.

🌐 Web Design & Front-End Development

Focus: Making creative, user-friendly websites.

Current Stack: HTML, CSS

Next: JavaScript → React.js → Node.js

Goals: Build responsive, interactive websites that connect to databases (full-stack).

🔒 Ethical Hacking & Cybersecurity

Focus: Understanding how systems are attacked and defended.

Topics Learned:

Network scanning (ping, tracert, etc.)

Basic penetration testing concepts

Common vulnerabilities (SQL injection, phishing, etc.)

Tools Exploring: Wireshark, Nmap, Metasploit (in learning environments)

Goal: Compete in Capture The Flag (CTF) challenges and understand ethical hacking fundamentals.

⚡ Automation & IoT

Interest Area: Connecting sensors and devices to the web.

Languages Used: Python, C++ (Arduino/ESP32)

Projects:

Air quality and energy monitoring system (MQ135 + PZEM-004T)

Firebase integration for real-time data visualization

Goal: Build a smart home dashboard that monitors energy usage and environment data.
